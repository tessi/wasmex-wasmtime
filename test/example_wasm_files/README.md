# Example WASM Files

This directory contains a number of pre-compiled WASM files (if possible with their sources in WAT format).

To compile WAT files either install the [WebAssembly Binary Toolki](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt) or try the [online compiler](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/).

This is the list of files with their sources:

* `simple.{wasm,wat}`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Text_format_to_wasm#A_first_look_at_the_text_format
